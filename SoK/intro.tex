\section{Introduction} \label{sect:intro}

- resource usage and billing are top concerns for the majority of IT managers and CIOs 

- existing resource accounting, hard to verify the accuracy and correctness. Also, existing resource metering tools are designed for servers and data centers~\cite{?}.

Our key contributions:
\begin{itemize}
 \item A survey of current practice and emerging trends in verifiable resource accounting (VRA).
 \item A taxonomy and in-depth analysis of the state-of-the-art trusted computing mechanisms and cryptographic primitives supporting VRA.
 \item New observations and insights on adaptation of current VRA techniques to a {\em decentralized} cloud model.
\end{itemize} 



- out of scope: we do not consider pricing and billing

- verifying code or software integrity~\cite{SLS05,SMV+10}, encoding format~\cite{DJO+12}

\section{Proofs of Storage} \label{sect:pos}

We adopt Juels and Kaliski's proof-of-retrievability (POR) scheme~\cite{JK07}.
Our setting has the following distinct requirements compared to those addressed by previous POR schemes:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Distributed storage
 \item Asynchronous proof generation: A POS can be generated by each worker individually without being dependent on other workers.
 \item Static \& dynamic data: The owner can dynamically update its datasets stored on the server, but the data delegated to workers is static.
 \item Untrusted data owner and workers: The data owner may refuse to accept a correctly generated POS from an honest worker.
\end{itemize}

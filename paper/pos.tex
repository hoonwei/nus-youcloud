\section{Proofs of Storage} \label{sect:pos}

We adopt Juels and Kaliski's proof-of-retrievability (POR) scheme~\cite{JK07}.
However, we do not require a full-fledged POR scheme for our purposes.
Our setting has the following distinctive characteristics in comparison to those previous POR schemes:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Distributed storage
 \item Asynchronous proof generation: A POS can be generated by each worker individually without being dependent on other workers.
 \item Static \& dynamic data: The owner can dynamically update its datasets stored on the server, but the data delegated to workers is static.
 \item Untrusted data owner and workers: The data owner may refuse to accept a correctly generated POS from an honest worker.
\end{itemize}

- we don't need retrievability, i.e., erasure code

- malicious worker may refuse to release computed results (we discuss how to deal with this problem in \S~\ref{sect:fairness})

- we need to use an encryption scheme which supports secure computation over encrypted data

- one challenge is how to reduce the number of verification required over multiple workers (currently a prover can convince a verifier with a constant number of challenges/responses for each file).

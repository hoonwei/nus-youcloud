\section{Introduction} \label{sect:intro}

- centralized clouds are easier to manage, however, they are costly to maintain (e.g., high energy cost) and may not scale as well (in terms of the elasticity of demand from cloud subscribers).

- Centralized clouds owned by only few organizations imply the possibility of single points of failure.

- decentralized or cooperative clouds are attractive alternatives: multi-clouds, volunteer computing

- For example: BOINC~\cite{BOINC}, Cloud@Home~\cite{DP12}, MultCloud~\cite{MultCloud}, Symform~\cite{Symform}, Storj~\cite{Storj}, Syndicate~\cite{Syndicate}
